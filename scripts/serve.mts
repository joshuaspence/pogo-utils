/**
 * Serves the built site over HTTP, which is how it is run locally: the pages reach `data/*.gpx` and the events feed
 * through `fetch`, and a browser denies a `file://` document those requests.
 *
 * A handler of its own rather than esbuild's `servedir`, which knows the types of the assets it bundles and offers no
 * way to extend the table: `events.ics` came out `text/plain`, so the Events page's Subscribe link opened as a text
 * page instead of reaching a calendar client — the one part of that page a local run could not check.
 *
 * Taking that over means taking on surviving a bad request. A `throw` inside a `createServer` listener is an uncaught
 * exception rather than a failed request, so it ends the process and every later request is refused by a port with
 * nothing behind it: `/%` used to kill the server through `decodeURIComponent`, and `/%00.html` through `statSync`. So
 * everything that reads a request or the filesystem answers with a value instead, and every file read sits behind a
 * stream whose `'error'` is handled.
 *
 * Only an extension in `scripts/served-types.mts` is served at all. A file in `dist/` with any other is not part of
 * the site — `scripts/assemble.mts` fails the build over one, against that same table — so 404 is both the true answer
 * and the only one that never has to guess a type.
 *
 * No `fallback` for deep links: `src/router.ts` reads the route out of the fragment, so `#/map` is a request for `/`.

 * throws `TypeError` on a path carrying a NUL byte and `EACCES` on one under a directory it cannot read —
 * `throwIfNoEntry: false` turning only `ENOENT` and `ENOTDIR` into `undefined` and nothing else. Answering all of them
 * with a value is what keeps a bad request from being a dead server.
 *
 * `new URL` drops a query string but leaves the path percent-encoded, which is what `decodeURIComponent` is for;
 * `resolve` then collapses the `..` segments a path can carry. The result is checked back against the root rather than
 * trusted — a `relative` that climbs is how `/../package.json` and its `%2e%2e` spelling are both refused, while a
 * `..` that stays inside still resolves — and that check comes before the stat, so a path outside `dist/` is never
