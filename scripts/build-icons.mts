/**
 * Renders the installed-app icons from `favicon.svg` into the `dist/` the rest of `pnpm build` is assembling, so none
 * of them is a file anyone has to ignore and the `rm -rf dist` a build opens with clears one a renamed manifest entry
 * left behind.
 *
 * `manifest.json` is the authority on what to draw rather than a list of sizes here, so a size changed there cannot
 * disagree with the file published under it. `scripts/assemble.mts` copies nothing into `dist/icons/`, leaving this
 * the one producer, and checks every path the manifest names resolves — which catches an icon this failed to write.
 *
 * Nothing honours `prefers-color-scheme`, and that is the point: a launcher paints an icon once rather than per theme,
 * and a renderer with no concept of a theme takes `favicon.svg`'s default rim, which is the one an icon wants.
