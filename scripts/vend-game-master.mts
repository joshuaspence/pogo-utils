/**
 * Writes the game master fixture the corpus tests read their forms, moves, type names and CP multipliers out of. It
 * exists because a test of a reader must not reach the network, and the two files upstream are 23 MB for the 0.85 MB
 * anything here consults.
 *
 * Nothing reads the clock, so the output is a pure function of the three things `loadGameData` downloads and
 * `git diff --quiet` after a run answers exactly "has the game master moved?". That holds only if all three are
 * upstream's as of now, so they go into an empty directory rather than `CACHE` and a failed download throws.
 *
 * Written unpruned. Dropping the per-form move pools would take it from 0.85 MB to 0.35 MB and is the one cut worth
 * refusing: a move read off the screen is matched against its form's pool.
 *
 * Re-vending is a reviewed commit rather than a refresh — the counts the test pins move when upstream releases a
 * species, and a form that shares a dex, types and stamina with one already here changes which forms an HP can tell
 * apart.
