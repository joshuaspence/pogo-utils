/**
 * Where the national dex divides into generations: each generation number beside the first and last dex number it
 * covers. A fact about the games rather than about either page that reads it, which is why it lives here — the search
 * builder renders it as the `1-151` the game's search box takes and the Pokédex reads the bounds to label a card, and
 * neither owns the boundaries themselves.
 *
 * The bounds are numbers rather than a rendered `'1-151'`, so the one consumer that wants that string writes it and the
 * other compares dex numbers without parsing it back out again.
 *
 * The last generation's `last` is the dex itself, and moves when a generation is added to the game.
