/**
 * One species, or one of its forms — a dex number wearing a name. Naming a form or a region asks for one the species
 * actually has and hands back the Pokemon that form is, so a filter can say which form it means and still write the
 * one number PGSharp stores: `toJSON` leaves `JSON.stringify` to emit the dex number and nothing else.
 *
 * A species is built up a link at a time, and two things travel down the chain. The **cursor** is what a marker
 * applies to: every `is…`/`does…` marker lands on whatever was declared last, which is the species until a form or
 * region is named. These are properties of the form rather than the species, a species being able to have a shiny
 * where its regional variant does not, and undeclared reads as eligible. A Legendary, Mythical, Baby or Ultra Beast is
 * one the wild never turns up, so those four stop it spawning too — Meltan the lone Mythical that does, saying
 * `doesSpawn` after to put it back. A Regional still spawns, only somewhere particular, so it leaves spawning alone.
 *
 * The **target** is what a new form or region hangs off. `addForm`, `addForms`, `addRegion` and `addRegions` declare
 * peers at the current target and leave it there, so listing several is listing siblings; `withForm` and `withRegion`
 * descend into one, so what follows nests beneath.
 *
 * ```js
 * new Pokemon(128).withRegion(PALDEA).doesNotSpawn().addForms('COMBAT_BREED', 'BLAZE_BREED', 'AQUA_BREED');
 * ```
