/**
 * The whole of what the Build button computes, driven from a GPX file's text to the bytes a reader is handed.
 *
 * `favourites.ts` and `java-serialization.ts` are each tested on their own and that is what this adds nothing to. What
 * it adds is the join: which key gets which encoder, that the timezones are in the bytes rather than filled in after
 * they were written, that the control keys land in PGSharp's own order whatever order the reader ticked them in. Every
 * one of those is a backup PGSharp reads *wrongly* rather than refuses, so none of them surfaces as an error anywhere.
 *
 * The assertions read the stream back rather than hashing it. A digest over a backup carrying controls would be pinned
 * to `filters.ts` and `scan-config.ts`, which land on `master` as data — so a filter added to a list would fail this
 * suite for being a filter added to a list. What is pinned as literal text is the two favourite JSON strings, which
 * depend on this code and on the fixture alone.
