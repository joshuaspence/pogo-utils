/**
 * The on-screen control positions, written back into a synthesized backup. Two things here are contracts rather than
 * values: the bottom row's controls share a Y, which is what naming `CONTROL_ROW_Y` once is for, since a backup
 * restoring them a pixel apart is a row that looks wrong and reports nothing; and the key order decides the order the
 * entries land in the backup, this table being what `pgsdata.ts` walks with `Object.entries`.
 *
 * `hlscan` and `hlfeeds` are JSON strings rather than objects, so they are checked by parsing them back. That is the
 * one place `scan-config.js` reaches the device, which makes this where its contract is held too.
