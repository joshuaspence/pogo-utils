/**
 * The reductions, and the arrangements they are deliberately silent about.
 *
 * Every one of them is local to one junction node, which is what the canvas changed: the earlier builder AND'd one
 * clause per category, so "this category's terms" and "the terms AND'd with the rest" were the same set. An
 * arrangement can put a category's terms in two groups, or inside an `any` the rest of the query is not AND'd with, so
 * each case below says which junction it is about — and the pair of cases per reduction, one for each junction, is
 * where the work is.
 *
 * Every expectation is derived from `terms.js` and pinned against it first. A test that spells out `shadow&!purified`
 * is asserting that two ids still exist and still sit in a category declaring exclusivity; a renamed id would leave it
 * asserting nothing, and that reads exactly like a pass.
