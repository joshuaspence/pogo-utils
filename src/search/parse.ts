/**
 * A typed search read back into an arrangement.
 *
 * This is the inverse of `clauses.js`, and the reason it exists is that the inverse is the easy direction: a reader can
 * write the search they mean with brackets in it, and the page can put the pills where the brackets say and let the
 * composer write out something the game will take. `(pikachu&shiny),(pumpkaboo&xxl)` arrives as two groups inside an
 * `any` and leaves as the four clauses the game needs.
 *
 * What it is *not* is a second composer. Nothing here writes a string; it writes a tree, the canvas draws it, and the
 * one composer takes it from there. So a typed query is an import rather than another way to ask the same question —
 * the pills land on the canvas and can be dragged about afterwards like any others.
 *
 * **The operators are the game's own, and both sources agree on them now.** Niantic's list groups `|` with `&` as an
 * AND, and the community phrase list says it outright: "`&` or `|` — AND combination", "`,` or `;` or `:` — OR
 * combination". An earlier text box here refused `|` for want of a second source, `pkgosearch.com` reading it as an
 * OR; two lists against one converter is enough to stop refusing it.
 *
 * A negation is carried down rather than kept as a node, which is De Morgan's law applied while reading: a negated
 * `all` is an `any` of negated parts. That is not a convenience but the whole of why this fits — `tree.js` keeps
 * negation on the pills and has no negated group, so a tree whose only negations are on its leaves is the only kind
 * the canvas can draw.
