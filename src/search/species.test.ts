/**
 * The rows the name box offers, which exist to close a gap nothing else here can: `pokedex.js` names a species by a
 * constant with its punctuation dropped, so a reader can type `farfetchd` where the game answers to `Farfetch'd`. The
 * fold is on the matching side and the row writes the game's own spelling back — the same gap `optimise.js` refuses to
 * cross, having only the constant to go on.
 *
 * So every failure here is a query that looks right and finds the wrong thing, or nothing: a species the game has not
 * released, a form it has no name for, a name written as the reader typed it rather than as the game spells it. A row
 * is taken on trust and pasted into a search that drives a mass transfer, so none of that surfaces as an error.
 *
 * Each case is built on the real dex, so each pins the shape of the data it needs first — a fragment reaching six
 * species today and two tomorrow is a test that has quietly stopped being about anything.
