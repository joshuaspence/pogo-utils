/**
 * Every term the builder can put in a search string, grouped the way the page lays them out. One table, so a term is
 * added, corrected or relabelled in a single place and the page, the query writer and the shareable link all follow.
 *
 * `term` is what goes in the string, verbatim and lowercased, because that is what the game reads, where `label` is
 * what the chip says: `4*` is a term no label would spell that way. `id` is what a link carries (`#i=shiny.evolve`),
 * so it is stable in a way a label is not, and defaults to the term where that is already a plain word.
 *
 * A group's `join` defaults to `,`, most of these groups describing one slot on a Pokémon — nothing is two generations
 * or two star ratings. `status` and `moves` are the exceptions, a Pokémon being any number of those at once. Which is
 * why a pair that is one slot gets a group of its own rather than a place among the statuses: grouped there,
 * `legendary&mythical` and `shadow&purified` would match nothing where a reader wanted the comma.
 *
 * `exclusive` and `exhaustive` are the two facts `optimise.js` shortens a clause by: at most one term is ever true, and
 * at least one always is. Neither follows from `join` or from the other — Type is exhaustive and not exclusive, where
 * Appraisal is both and Size only exclusive — and each buys a reduction of its own, which is why they are two fields.
 * Generation carries neither, though a species is in exactly one: its terms are dex spans, which `optimise.js` folds
 * into the one span covering them, and declaring the fact would only let the weaker reduction win.
 *
 * A term's `covers` names the terms it is the union of, which `background` is of the two backdrops. It costs that group
 * the exclusivity above, `background` overlapping both the terms it covers, so `background&!locationbackground` is the
 * Event backdrops and a search a reader would want.
 *
 * A group's `hue` tints its chips. Hues rather than the palette's tokens, these being categories of the page's own;
 * `theme.css` owns the colours that carry meaning across pages. Fifteen hues is as far as that carries: the widest gap
 * left on the wheel is 30°, so a sixteenth would land within 15° of a neighbour and stop saying which group it is.
 *
 * Which is why the four groups that read a *type* share one. A hue names a category and all four of them are the
 * eighteen types — what separates them is the operator, and that is in each chip's own label rather than in its colour.

 *

 * the three counts take five digits, which is past any storage or candy total the game can hold, where a figure chosen
 * to look plausible would have rewritten a real `countcandy50000`.
 *
 * `megalevel` is the one ceiling that is a judgement. Bulbapedia lists a fourth mega level, Super Max, and the
 * community phrase list gives "1/2/3/4 = Base/High/Max/Super Max" — but carries `// Super Max not personally confirmed
 * yet.` in its own source beside that row. So `max: 3` holds the level both sources stand behind and no more, and the
 * cost is that `mega4` pasted into the Advanced pane composes `mega3` rather than being refused. `buddylevel`'s 5
 * needs no such sentence: both sources give it outright.
 *
 * Buddy and Mega level belong here rather than among the terms above: they are levels, so a reader wants a span of them
 * — `Good Buddy or better` is `buddy2-`, the lower end picked and the upper left open — which is how the references
 * spell them too, Niantic's own list saying "enter `buddy0–5`" and Bulbapedia giving that very `buddy2-` as its
 * example. The Max move levels and the two counts of unlocked Max moves are here for the same reason, and all five
 * start at 1: a Max species has its attack unlocked from the first, so `{N}` counts from one and `dynamax0` is a
 * search for nothing.
 *
 * A level is also the *only* buddy search: those two references and the community phrase list all document `buddy{N}`,
 * and not one carries a flag for the buddy you have out, so there is no bare `buddy` among the terms above — the game
 * would read one as a nickname.
 *
 * A prefix that is the start of another prefix needs no ordering, `pill` in `parse.js` requiring the *tail* to be a
 * span: `countcandy248-` is not a `count` search, because `candy248-` is not a number.

 * the chip rather than as a span, both spellings asking the same thing and the chip's being shorter. That leaves the
 * reading below for `mega` and `count`, and leaves all four to the caveat in `clauses.js`.
 *
 * `greedy` is whether the phrase still swallows a longer word that starts with it. All four did; the list records
 * `mega` as patched in spring 2026 and the other three as remaining affected, which is what makes this a field.
 *
 * Read on the way in and never written on the way out. A reader pasting the game's own `count` gets the pill it stands
 * for, which is the courtesy `parse.js` already pays `cp3000-0`; composing one back would hand that reader a string
 * that is itself a shortcut, where the span spelled out is the one spelling nothing can swallow.

 * The four shapes a span is written in, as one pattern: `100`, `100-200`, `100-` and `-200`. A match with neither bound
 * is not a span at all — a lone `-`, or the empty tail a text that is only a prefix leaves — so both readers check for
 * one before trusting the groups.
 *
 * One pattern because the two readers of it — `parse.js` and `optimise.js` — sit on either side of `tree.js`, which
 * writes these and reads none: `optimise.js` reads a dex pill back *through that writer*, so a copy loosened on its own
 * would silently stop recognising what the writer had just produced. What the readers do with an open end is still
 * theirs to decide, and they differ: `parse.js` leaves it open, where a span in `optimise.js` is a closed interval and
 * closes it against the dex.
