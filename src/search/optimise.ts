/**
 * Compressing a finished query. Every reduction here rewrites the *tree* rather than the string and hands back another
 * tree for `query.js` to compose, so the shortened string goes through the same distribution and the same clause
 * writer as the plain one. Nothing takes apart a search string that was just written.
 *
 * Three kinds of redundancy are worth removing. A **name longer than it has to be**, since the game reads
 * `charmander`, `charma` and `4` alike — a pill is shortened wherever it sits, this being the one reduction that needs
 * to know nothing about what is around it. **Dex numbers said twice**, the AND'd spans collapsing into their
 * intersection. And **a category saying what its own terms already settle**, which `terms.js` declares through
 * `exclusive`, `exhaustive` and `covers`.
 *
 * **Every one of the three is local to one node**, which is what the canvas changed: the earlier builder AND'd one
 * clause per category, so "this category's terms" and "the terms AND'd with everything else" were the same set. An
 * arrangement can put a category's terms in two groups, or inside an `any` the rest of the query is not AND'd with, so
 * each reduction asks only about one junction's own parts. A pill one group over is a pill this knows nothing about,
 * which is the only reading that cannot make a search broader than it was.
 *
 * What is *not* reduced is a category's terms arriving at one junction with mixed polarity — an `any` holding `shadow`
 * beside `!purified` is `!purified`, and goes out as it came in. The facts in `terms.js` are stated for the reading
 * where a category's choices sit on one side.
 *
 * What is not here at all is folding `+charmander` into `4,5,6`, which needs to know which species share a family —
 * nothing in this repository holds that. So a `+` keeps its name and gets the name shortening alone, which is sound
 * because the same species reached a shorter way are the same families.
