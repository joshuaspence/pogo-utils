/**
 * The query tree, written out as the clauses the game reads.
 *
 * Pokémon GO's search box takes no brackets. What it takes is clauses separated by `&`, each a list of alternatives
 * separated by `,`, `:` or `;`, each alternative a term or a term behind a `!` — which is all Niantic's own list
 * documents, mentioning no grouping of any kind.
 *
 * That shape is conjunctive normal form, and every boolean expression has one. So the canvas can let a reader arrange
 * the search they actually mean and this writes it back out as something the box will take: two pills in an `any`
 * inside an `all` beside two more comes out as four clauses, not one of which anybody would have thought to write.
 *
 * **The precedence is the one assumption under all of this, and it is documented.** A clause list joined with `&`
 * only means what the canvas said if a comma binds tighter than an ampersand — `fire,water&shiny` has to read as a
 * shiny that is Fire or Water. The community phrase list — `https://leidwesen.github.io/SearchPhrases/`, the same
 * reference the two negation bugs below are read off — says so in its storage table: "Ambiguity is resolved by always
 * considering `,`s nested inside `&`s", with `meowth,alola&vulpix,galar` as the example. Niantic's own list never
 * combines the two operators, so the community one is what settles it.
 *
 * That reference also notes that searches "do not take priority over each other", which is about its *Pokédex* table —
 * a different box with its own phrase list. This file read that as doubt about the line above for a while: a claim from
 * a three-table reference is worth nothing until you know which search it is a claim about.
 *
 * What the form costs is characters, an `any` multiplying where an `all` adds, which is its nature rather than a
 * shortcoming: `(a&b),(c&d)` really is four clauses in a language with no brackets.
 *
 * Nothing here pushes a negation anywhere, `tree.js` keeping negation on the pills: the tree arrives in negation
 * normal form and De Morgan is the reader's own doing.

 * however its number was spelled — the game reads `4hp`, `3-defense` and `-1attack` alike, and takes a bare `mega` as
 * `mega0-`.
 *
 * The reference's capture has the game ignoring the negation on an IV term outright: `!1hp` is `1hp`, so the clause
 * asks for the Pokémon it was meant to rule out and looks entirely right doing it. A negated mega level answers only
 * with species that can Mega Evolve, rather than with everything else.
 *
 * The buddy level is the third and the one that is not a quirk of the term itself: the same reference records that a

 * That is a state rather than a spelling, so it reaches the positive form too — it is named here because the negative
 * is where it costs something, *Safe to transfer* ruling out the one Pokémon in hand instead of every one ever walked.
 *
 * Which is a choice rather than an oversight, and the asymmetry is in what the reader can see. A positive `buddy2-`
 * under that state answers with the one Pokémon in hand, and a list of one where a reader expected their Good Buddies
 * is a result they can disbelieve. A negated one answers the other way: the transfer list it guards fills up with the
 * Pokémon it was supposed to hold back, and nothing about it looks wrong. `mishandling` reads the negated clauses for
 * that reason rather than for want of the other half.
 *
 * None of the three is this page's doing — nothing between here and the string manufactures a negation. They are named
 * because this page's output ends up in a mass transfer, where a term that means its own opposite is worth a sentence.

/**
 * The four spellings of a level, as a pattern taken from the range's own bounds rather than transcribed from them. A
 * `[0-3]` written here beside a `max: 3` in `terms.js` is the copy of a bound that fails quietly: a `megalevel` raised
 * the day Super Max is confirmed would drop every `mega4` string out of the note below, with nothing failing in a
 * string this page says is worth a sentence because it ends up in a mass transfer.
 *
 * The levels are an alternation rather than a character class, so a ceiling that ever reaches double digits still means
 * the number it says where `[0-10]` would mean nought, one and nought. `bare` is the prefix on its own, which the
 * phrase list documents for `mega` — "`mega` is a shortcut of `mega0-`" — and documents for nothing else.
 *
 * The affix is whichever side of the span the range writes, which `spanned` in `tree.js` composes the same way round:
 * a prefix for a level, a suffix for an IV — `hp{N}` is the stat where `{N}hp` is the band. It is held to a bare word
 * of at least one letter, the alternative being a `.` or a `+` in one that over-matches silently rather than failing,
 * and one letter rather than none because `dex` carries neither: a pattern built without an affix would attach a
 * caveat to every negated dex pill, `!151` reported as a mishandled level search.
 *
 * `RangeId` on the parameter, not `string`: this runs while the module initialises and `query.js` imports it, so a
 * range renamed in `RANGE_TABLE` would otherwise compile and then throw on the way to a blank Search page.
