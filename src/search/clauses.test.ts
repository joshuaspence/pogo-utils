/**
 * Whether the clauses say what the arrangement said.
 *
 * That is the one thing worth proving here, and pinning output strings barely touches it: an `any` of two `all`s has a
 * right answer four clauses long, and a reader comparing it against a literal in a test file is checking a
 * transcription rather than the arithmetic. So each case is built as the tree the canvas would hold, read twice — once
 * through `clausesOf`, and once as a predicate this file evaluates itself — and the two are compared over every
 * assignment of the terms in them. One assertion then covers the distribution, the absorption, the clause that asks
 * nothing and the pill that has nothing to say, and it goes on covering them when any of those is rewritten.
 *
 * The tree is the input, so there is no parser between the test and the thing under test and no spelling to agree
 * about. What `tree.js` keeps negation on the pills buys here is that nothing has to be put into negation normal form
 * first: a case is already in it.
 *
 * Nothing is derived from `terms.js` except the terms themselves, since what the arithmetic does is true of any pill.
 * Real ones are used all the same, a case that reads as a search being a case worth checking.
