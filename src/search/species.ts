 *
 * Forms and regional variants are left out. The game searches the name it shows, and that name is the species' —
 * `pokemon_name_0019` is `Rattata` for the Alolan one as much as the Kantonian — so `Alolan Rattata` answers to
 * nothing, and the Regional forms chips are how a reader asks for that.

 * being something `pokedex.js` cannot say, carrying forms, regions and rarity but no evolution links.
