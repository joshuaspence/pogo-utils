/**
 * The GPX route map: every track and waypoint in the repository, drawn on Leaflet and listed in a sidebar grouped by
 * continent and country.
 *
 * Leaflet is imported by name rather than by member, which is what leaves all the `L.` references and the `L.Polyline`-
 * style annotations exactly as the UMD global left them. Its stylesheet is not imported here, though this is the only
 * module that needs it: a sheet imported from a dynamically imported page lands in that page's own CSS file, which
 * esbuild emits and ships no runtime to fetch — see `src/main.tsx`, which imports all seven.
 *
 * The split between what is state here and what stays imperative follows who owns the object. The sidebar — which rows
 * exist, which are filtered out, which groups are open, what is selected — is this component's, and is rendered from
 * state; that is the half the imperative page spent `entry.el`, `rowOf`, `classList.toggle` and a `groups` array on. The
 * layers are Leaflet's: it owns their styling, their popups and the viewport, so they are created once and then told
 * about selection from an effect rather than rebuilt by a render.
