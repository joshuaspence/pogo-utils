 * the one the first pass read anyway, so the row is satisfied either way and nothing there distinguishes an assembly
 * from the fallback. What no capture reaches at all is two combinations checking out, and the single-digit percentage
 * below is a screen nobody has captured.
 *
 * The readings are quoted off the real loop, dumped out of `readOverlay` over every fixture, rather than invented. What
 * keeps them from going stale as transcription is the corpus itself: a treatment that starts reading those bands
 * differently moves the triple `articuno-galar.png`'s row denies, and `screens.test.mts` fails there.
