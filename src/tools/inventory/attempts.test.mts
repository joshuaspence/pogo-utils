/**
 * What `bestOf` reads and what it keeps, which is the decision `scripts/inventory.mts` makes about every Pokémon it
 * walks past and the one part of that walk no other test reaches: `cli.test.mts` drives the script as a subprocess,
 * and the only command there that needs no phone is `parse`, which reads a file once and retries nothing.
 *
 * So the scan's half of the contract is asserted here, against answers scripted as the fault scores a reading comes
 * out with — a screen read whole scoring nought, and each thing wrong with it raising the score. Which facts about a
 * reading count belongs with the scan, and which captures come out above nought is pinned over the real corpus in
 * `screens.test.mts`; how those facts rank against each other is `faultsOf`, asserted at the foot of this file. This
 * is the behaviour those leave unstated: that a score above nought is read again, that a score of nought is not, and
 * which of several answers comes back.
 *
 * `read` records the attempts it was handed throughout, so that how many times it was called is asserted alongside what
 * came back. An answer alone cannot say it: `bestOf` returning the clean answer is also what a reader called once and
 * lucky would produce.
