/**
 * Which species a Pokédex entry screen is showing, over lines built here rather than read off a capture.
 *
 * `dexOn` takes lines and a game master and no image at all, so a capture buys it nothing a line cannot state — and the
 * three entry captures this was written against carried the only copy of these cases while costing three megabytes of
 * LFS between them. What a capture *could* state and these cannot is that Tesseract reads the title line at all, which
 * is why `screens.test.mts` still asserts the other half: that no capture in the corpus names a dex.
 *
 * The lines are the shape `ocr.mts` answers, text and a box, with positions that no assertion here reads — `dexOn`
 * walks every line and cares only about the text. They are written out rather than factored into a builder because the
 * text is the whole of each case and a helper would hide it.
