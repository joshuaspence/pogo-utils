 * check it by, and brightness at 180 says `00 9114/13/14`, whose `91` is what 14/13/14 comes to.
 *
 * `articuno-galar.png` is the case this settles without either pass having read it. Near-white says `10/4/13`,
 * brightness at 180 says `12/4/ 3` and prints the right `164`, and neither triple comes to the percentage beside it —
 * so nothing confirms, and `assembled` asks this the same question about every combination of the fields the two
 * passes read instead. Only `12/4/13` comes to the `64`.
 *
 * It is the end of the last run of digits ahead of the triple rather than a whole word, since it runs into what is
 * beside it — `xurkitree.png`'s `82` arrives as `182`. And that run must not be the level alone, because a treatment
 * that drops the coloured percentage leaves the level as the last run, and a level of 20 would confirm any triple
 * summing to 9; so it is the `L` that says which run is the level. Where the `L` reads as a `1` that cannot be told
 * apart, `120` being a level of 20 as readily as a level of 1 and a percentage of 20.
 *
 * Two digits of it at least, because one is no checksum: a single digit ends almost any run, so `L20` would confirm a
 * triple summing to 0 and `182` one summing to 1 — and the `L` cannot be what rules those out, since the run carrying
 * the digit need not be a level at all.
 *
 * What that refuses is the 35 triples of 4,096 that sum under 5, whose percentage is one digit, and it refuses them
 * outright rather than only where the digit was borrowed from a longer run: all 35 could confirm themselves off a
 * percentage printed as its own run, and none can now. So a 0/0/0 screen loses a `chosen` as well as an `assembled` and
 * stands on the fallback, which is where any reading with no checksum beside it stands. The confirmation it loses was
