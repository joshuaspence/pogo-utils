 * its cache is, and no flag or stub is needed to move it.
 *
 * All three files are load-bearing, and that is measured rather than reasoned about — seeded with `game-master.json`
 * alone, a `parse` run prints two `Downloading` lines and goes out for the icon index and the string table. Only
 * `game-master.json`'s *contents* matter: `loadGameData` throws without a CP multiplier for every level, where an empty
 * icon index and an empty string table it takes in its stride.
 *
 * That emptiness is also what lets the stderr below be asserted at all. No form means no icon to read, so nothing is
 * fetched and nothing is reported, and an empty stderr is then exactly the claim that the seeded cache was read rather
 * than merely present.
 *
 * The multipliers themselves are arbitrary values over more levels than the game has, and safe to be both: no assertion
 * here reads a number derived from them, and over-supplying keeps this from pinning the scanner's highest level.
 *
 * `extra` is appended to those templates, for the one test below that needs a form to exist at all. It defaults to none
 * so that every other caller keeps the emptiness the paragraph above turns into an assertion.
 *
 * `icons` names what the index holds, and writes each file into the cache beside it. Both halves are load-bearing
 * and for different reasons: the index is what carries a name onto a form, so it decides whether a family counts as
 * drawn or as short of its artwork, and the files are what keep a drawn one off the network. Their contents are
 * arbitrary — a pixel apiece, no assertion here reading a signature — but they have to decode, an icon that does

 * forms short of an icon, so the family lands in `short` rather than `drawn`, `drawn.length` is 0 and `Reading N form
 * icons` is never printed at all — measured by reverting that one line to `console.error`, which left the whole suite
 * green.
 *
 * Giving the index both icons and writing both files is what moves the family across. The week's grace reads them
 * off disk, so the count prints with nothing fetched, and `short` is empty for the same reason — which is why this
 * asserts a count where the test above asserts the families, the two lines being gated together and reached apart.
