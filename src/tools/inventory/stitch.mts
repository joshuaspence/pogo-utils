/**
 * One tall image out of several screenshots taken while scrolling, which is the only way to see a screen that is longer
 * than the phone all at once. The detail screen is one: an unscrolled capture reaches the moves at its foot and stops
 * there, short of the catch details below them.
 *
 * **Not everything on the screen scrolls, and that is the whole problem.** The status bar ticks with the clock at the
 * top, PGSharp draws its overlay *over* the app rather than in it so it stays exactly where it is, and the game's own
 * round buttons float above the panel at the bottom. Correlating two frames over the whole screen therefore finds the
 * shift that keeps the furniture still — which is zero — rather than the one that lines the content up. So the caller
 * names the band that does scroll, and everything here works inside it.
 *
 * **What it answers with is the content once and the furniture once.** Rows above the band come from the first frame,
 * rows below it from the last, and the band itself is the first frame's worth plus whatever each later frame revealed.
 * A naive concatenation would repeat both the overlay and the buttons once per frame.
 *
 * **It refuses rather than guesses.** `offsetBetween` scores every candidate shift and takes the best only where it is
 * clearly better than the field; two frames that overlap by too little to be sure, or not at all, answer null and the
 * capture stops there with what it has. A capture that is short is obvious to whoever looks at it, where a capture
 * silently assembled at the wrong offset is a screenshot of something that was never on the screen.
