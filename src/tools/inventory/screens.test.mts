/**
 * What the detail screen's readers make of real screens, over the corpus of captures committed beside this file.
 *
 * **A row says what the Pokémon is, not what the readers answered.** A `Fixture` is the screen; a `Defects` beside it
 * is where some reader answers something else, pinned rather than softened away — fixing one is a change to the code
 * and so a pull request of its own. Everything after that is derived from the pair, so a consequence cannot drift from
 * its cause, and `COVERAGE` pins the counts rather than leaving them to prose nothing checks.
 *
 * `NEGATIVE` holds the captures that are not detail screens, asserting the readers do not invent on a screen none of
 * them was written for. `no-pgsharp.png` and `pgsharp-no-overlay.png` are one Squirtle captured twice and so a control
 * on each other, the same screen reading `CP 330` on one and `CP 390` on the other.
