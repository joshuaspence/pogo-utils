 * Telling two forms apart by the artwork, for the ones the numbers cannot reach. HP is a function of `stamina` alone,

 * Deerling's four seasons, Burmy's three, Genesect's five and more. `identify` folds them to one and answers with no
 * alternatives and no notes, which is a wrong answer that flags nothing.
 *
 * **The backdrop is the whole problem, not the colours.** The game blurs an arbitrary scene behind the model and will
 * put a photograph there, against which a small model is a minority of any fixed box. So the subject is bounded by the
 * panel below it and by sharpness, edges being what a blurred scene lacks, and only the one connected run of what those
 * edges enclose that holds the most colour is kept — a flat backdrop with crisp shapes on it has edges too, and growing
 * the mask from them would flood it.
 *
 * **Judge it on the margin.** Seventeen committed captures fall in a reachable family; at `MARGIN` the match answers
 * five and is right on all five, and ten of the twelve it declines are nearest an icon that is not their own. So the
 * margin is what stands between the match and being confidently wrong ten times.
