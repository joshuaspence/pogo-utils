/**
 * The Pokédex entry screen, which is the way round the two things that hide a species from the detail screen: a
 * nickname printed where the name goes, and the `♀` or `♂` of a species' own name that OCR loses.
 *
 * **The dex number settles it and the name beside it does not.** Over the three captures measured, `0585`, `0032` and
 * `0029` read exactly right off the ordinary whole-screen pass, where the names come back `DEERLING`, `NIDORAN` and
 * `NIDORAN ?` — the two Nidoran losing their glyph here as they do on the detail screen, and `fold` mapping both to the
 * same `nidoran`.
 *
 * **It answers the species and never the form.** Opening an entry does not preselect that Pokémon's form, so the
 * selected tile says nothing about the Pokémon the walk came from however legible it is. Legible and meaningless is
 * the worst thing a reader can be offered, so nothing here reads it.
 *
 * **Nothing beats a wrong answer here**, which is what the cross-check below is for: the screen carries other
 * four-digit numbers — `SEEN 2763`, `CAUGHT 1499` — so a reader taking the first it finds would file a species off a
 * counter. A number is accepted only where it resolves to a species *and* the name beside it folds to that same
 * species. The species half refuses the counters, and the name half refuses the status bar, whose `09:00` reads as
 * `0900 M © Os` where 900 is Kleavor.

 *
 * Searched anywhere in the folded line rather than anchored, because the game draws a circular-arrows glyph ahead of
 * the number: it folds away to nothing on all three captures, reading as `©`, and an anchor would be betting that it

 * Which species a Pokédex entry screen is showing, as its dex number, or null where the screen does not say so beyond

 *
 * `data` is here for the cross-check rather than for the lookup: the number names a species, the line names one too,
 * and the two have to be the same species before either is believed. That is what makes a `SEEN` or `CAUGHT` counter
 * inert — 2763 is no species, and a count that did happen to land on a dex number carries no name beside it.
 *
 * The name is compared by exact folded equality rather than through `closest`, which is a deliberate departure from
 * every other name here. Slack exists to rescue a reading that is the only evidence there is; this reading is not
 * evidence at all but a check on a number that already answered, so slack would only widen what the check lets past.
 * Both Nidoran fold to `nidoran` and pass it, which is the point: the check says the line agrees, and the **number**
 * says which of the two. The species has to lead the line rather than be the whole of it, since what follows the name
 * is OCR's reading of the `♀` or `♂` the name lost, or of the form counter beside it — `NIDORAN d` is still Nidoran.
