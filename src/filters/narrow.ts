 * undefined and would reach the caller as a null. The constant's name is gone by then, so the error gives the position
 * to look at — and the species are taken in the order they were written, so that position means what it says.
 *
 * Every `keep` has to hold for an entry to stay, which is how a filter drops what has no shiny to find. They run before
 * the list collapses, so a species listed twice keeps the form that survives rather than whichever came first.
 *
 * A form carries the dex number of the species it belongs to, that number being all either tool stores, so a list
 * naming several forms names it several times. The names say which forms the list is for; the repeats say nothing, so
 * the first of each number survives and the rest go.
