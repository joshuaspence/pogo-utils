/**
 * What a `<pgr:event>` reference is, and what cutting one does to the file around it — the two halves of one
 * agreement, since a form the validator reads and the pruner does not is an event pruned here and refused there,
 * failing every Pages deploy until the file is edited by hand.
 *
 * The forms below are the ones a line-matching reader gets wrong and a parser does not: inline among siblings,
 * whitespace around the ID, CRLF endings, a prefix other than `pgr`. None is in `data/` today, which is why they are
 * written out rather than read from it — a corpus test can only pin the shape the corpus happens to be in.
 *
 * The cases that refuse matter more than the ones that cut. A span that over-runs deletes whatever followed, the file
 * can still parse afterwards, and the Prune workflow commits that to `master` unwatched — so every shape this cannot
 * read for certain is pinned here as a throw.
