/**
 * The local server, driven as a subprocess. Nothing imported `scripts/serve.mts` before this, and nothing under
 * `scripts/` is reachable by the suite at all — `vitest.config.mjs` scopes `dir` to `src/` — so three inputs that
 * ended the process rather than the request passed 1272 tests without being seen: `/%` through `decodeURIComponent`,
 * `/%00.html` through `statSync`, and an unreadable file through a `createReadStream` whose `'error'` nothing handled.
 *
 * Driven rather than imported because importing it runs it: the `dist/` guard, `createServer` and `listen` are all at
 * the top level. A subprocess is also the interface a person uses, and the one where a `throw` in a request listener
 * shows up as what it is — a dead server rather than a rejected promise.
 *
 * `DIST` in that script is relative, which is the whole of why this is hermetic: the directory a subprocess runs in
 * decides what it serves, so each test gets a `dist/` of its own holding one file per extension and no build is
 * needed. The same property is what `src/tools/inventory/cli.test.mts` uses for the scanner's cache.
 *
 * Every crash test asserts twice — the bad request got an answer, and a later good request still gets one. The second
 * assertion is the one that would have caught these: a dead server also "answers" the first request, with a socket
 * error that reads much like a refusal if nothing looks any further.
 *
 * What this cannot check is the table itself. It reads `SERVED_TYPES` to assert against, so it pins that the server
 * honours the table and says nothing about whether the table still matches the deployment. Nothing here does — a
 * header Pages changes is found by `curl -sI` against the published file, not by this going red.
