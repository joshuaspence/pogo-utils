/**
 * The country table, whose row *set* is already checked better than a test could manage: `validate-gpx.mts` reads it
 * against the `<pgr:country>` of every GPX file in both directions, so a country added ahead of its first route fails
 * `pnpm lint` as surely as one that was never added. What nothing checks is the two fields on each row.
 *
 * Both fail silently, and differently. The flag is derived from the code rather than pasted in, so a code that is not
 * alpha-2 draws the wrong flag or none — and a backup build errors on a country with no code at all, which is the one
 * loud failure here. A continent is not validated anywhere: the sidebar groups by whatever string it finds and files an
 * unknown one under "Other", so a `Euorpe` is a country that vanishes from its own continent on a page that renders
 * perfectly.
