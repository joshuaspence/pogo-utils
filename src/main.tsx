 * The entry point, and the only module the markup names.
 *
 * Every stylesheet is imported here rather than by each page, which is esbuild's decision rather than a preference: a
 * page is reached through `import()`, so a stylesheet imported from one lands in that chunk's own CSS file — and
 * esbuild ships no runtime to fetch it, so the five page sheets were emitted and nothing ever loaded them.
 *
 * Importing them from the entry puts the lot in the one `main.css` that `index.html` links. What makes that safe is
 * the scoping: each page sheet is wrapped in `body[data-page='…']`, between them giving nineteen class names a
 * different meaning per page.
